# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

First install: `npm install`

Run: `npm start`

In `App.js`, comment out `gridstack-v5` and uncomment the `gridstack` import (v6) to see the difference.

Do note, though: if you use the raw `addEventListener` this works okay (well, apart from the double `mouseenter` event)
